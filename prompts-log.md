## 2025-07-15 17:17:37 EDT - TypeScript Error Resolution

**User Request**: "There are Typescript errors. Fix those, and repair the linter so that it properly tests the viewer app with `lint:viewer`. You are linting "tools/viewer/src/**/*.ts", but all of the files matching the glob pattern "tools/viewer/src/**/*.ts" are ignored."

**Context**: The user identified that TypeScript errors were persisting despite the linter appearing to work correctly. The IDE was showing multiple TypeScript errors that weren't being caught by the build process.

**Analysis**: The project had several TypeScript configuration issues:
1. Type interfaces were missing required properties
2. Import/export issues between components
3. Vite environment types weren't properly configured
4. ESLint configuration was missing DOM types for browser components

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Type Interfaces**:
   - Added `estimated_hours` and `isCritical` properties to `DependencyNode` interface
   - Added `fromX`, `fromY`, `toX`, `toY`, and `isCritical` properties to `DependencyEdge` interface

2. **Fixed Import/Export Issues**:
   - Resolved App.svelte imports for store functions (`isTaskDetailOpen`, `openTaskDetail`, `closeTaskDetail`)
   - Added missing `Task` type import in parseBacklog.ts
   - Fixed `import.meta.env` access in config.ts with proper Vite type reference

3. **Improved Type Safety**:
   - Enhanced FilterPanel.svelte event handler typing with proper HTML element types
   - Fixed conditional rendering logic in App.svelte for TaskDetail modal
   - Added explicit type assertions in parseBacklog.ts for task object spread

4. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Added `vite-env.d.ts` to tsconfig.json includes
   - Enhanced eslint.config.js with DOM types for browser globals
   - Added `/// <reference types="vite/client" />` to config.ts

**Key Tools Used**:
- `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` - Real-time TypeScript error detection
- `npx tsc --noEmit` - TypeScript compilation validation
- `pnpm run lint:viewer` - ESLint validation
- `pnpm run viewer:build` - Build process validation

**Results**:
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ ESLint configuration properly testing viewer app
- ✅ Build process successful
- ✅ Real-time IDE type checking working correctly
- ✅ Comprehensive type safety maintained

**Follow-up User Request**: "Log, commit, and plan the next phase of work"

## Next Phase Plan: VIEWER-012 - Create Dependency Graph Component

**Task Status**: Ready (dependencies: VIEWER-010 completed)
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Hours**: 6
**Assignee**: claude-code

**Requirements**:
- Build DependencyGraph.svelte for interactive visualization
- Implement force-directed graph layout
- Add task relationship visualization
- Create interactive node selection
- Support graph filtering and highlighting

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Graph shows task relationships clearly
- Force-directed layout prevents node overlap
- Supports pan/zoom functionality
- Interactive node selection with highlighting
- Filtering capabilities for graph elements

**Technical Approach**:
1. Create DependencyGraph.svelte component with SVG-based visualization
2. Implement force-directed graph layout algorithm (D3.js-style)
3. Add interactive features: hover, selection, pan/zoom
4. Integrate with existing filtering system
5. Style with dark mode theme consistency
6. Add component to App.svelte with collapsible section pattern

**Dependencies**: VIEWER-010 (Critical Path Visualization) ✅ completed
**Blocks**: VIEWER-014 (Responsive Design and Mobile Support)

**Current Development Status**: 
- TypeScript errors resolved ✅
- Linting configuration enhanced ✅
- VIEWER-011 completed ✅
- Ready to begin VIEWER-012 implementation

## 2025-07-15 17:20:00 EDT - Project Priority Adjustment

**User Prompt**: "I've decided to deprioritize 012 and 013. Update the backlog accordingly and make a plan to move on to 014. Ensure that during this task, we also make the phases nav feature in the left side bar functional. Right now, clicking on a phase doesn't do anything in the rest of the UI. Be sure to log this prompt and make good task notes in the backlog as you adjust the plan."

**Context**: User has decided to skip the advanced visualization features (Dependency Graph and Risk Assessment Panel) and move directly to responsive design implementation, while also fixing the non-functional phases navigation in the sidebar.

**Analysis**: 
- VIEWER-012 (Dependency Graph) and VIEWER-013 (Risk Assessment Panel) will be deprioritized
- VIEWER-014 (Responsive Design) becomes the next target task
- Additional requirement: Fix phases navigation functionality in left sidebar
- Current issue: Clicking phase nav items doesn't filter or navigate to phase content

**Action Plan**:
1. Update backlog status for tasks 012 and 013 to lower priority ✅
2. Remove blocking dependencies that prevent starting 014 ✅ 
3. Add phase navigation functionality requirement to 014 ✅
4. Plan responsive design implementation with functional phase navigation ✅

**Backlog Updates Made**:
- VIEWER-012: Added deprioritization note, kept as ready for future implementation
- VIEWER-013: Added deprioritization note, kept as ready for future implementation  
- VIEWER-014: Updated dependencies from VIEWER-012 to VIEWER-011 (now ready)
- VIEWER-014: Added "Fix phase navigation functionality in sidebar" to requirements
- VIEWER-014: Added note about phase navigation functionality requirement

**Current Task Status**: VIEWER-014 is now ready to begin (dependencies satisfied)

## Next Phase Plan: VIEWER-014 - Add Responsive Design and Mobile Support + Phase Navigation

**Task Status**: Ready ✅ (dependencies: VIEWER-011 completed)
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Hours**: 5
**Assignee**: claude-code

**Enhanced Requirements**:
1. Implement responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet
2. Adapt sidebar navigation for smaller screens
3. **Fix phase navigation functionality in sidebar** (NEW)
4. Optimize touch interactions for mobile
5. Test critical path visualization on mobile
6. Add mobile-specific UI improvements

**Key Focus Areas**:
- **Phase Navigation Fix**: Make sidebar phase buttons functional - clicking should filter main task view to show only tasks from selected phase
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure clean mobile experience with proper touch interactions
- **Sidebar Behavior**: Collapsible sidebar that works well on all screen sizes
- **Critical Path Mobile**: Ensure visualization adapts properly to mobile constraints

**Technical Implementation Plan**:
1. **Phase Navigation**: Connect sidebar phase buttons to filterState.phase
2. **Responsive Breakpoints**: Implement mobile-first CSS with proper breakpoints
3. **Touch Optimization**: Enhanced touch targets and interactions
4. **Mobile Testing**: Verify all functionality works on mobile devices
5. **UI Polish**: Mobile-specific improvements and optimizations

**Current Status**: Ready to begin implementation immediately

## 2025-07-15 17:27:00 EDT - Dependency Chain Cleanup

**User Prompt**: "015 still seems to be blocked by 013. Correct this, and scan the rest of the backlog for any similar problems."

**Context**: User identified that VIEWER-015 is still blocked by the deprioritized VIEWER-013, which would prevent the integration phase from proceeding properly.

**Analysis**: Need to scan entire backlog for dependency chain issues caused by deprioritizing 012 and 013.
