## 2025-07-15 17:17:37 EDT - TypeScript Error Resolution

**User Request**: "There are Typescript errors. Fix those, and repair the linter so that it properly tests the viewer app with `lint:viewer`. You are linting "tools/viewer/src/**/*.ts", but all of the files matching the glob pattern "tools/viewer/src/**/*.ts" are ignored."

**Context**: The user identified that TypeScript errors were persisting despite the linter appearing to work correctly. The IDE was showing multiple TypeScript errors that weren't being caught by the build process.

**Analysis**: The project had several TypeScript configuration issues:
1. Type interfaces were missing required properties
2. Import/export issues between components
3. Vite environment types weren't properly configured
4. ESLint configuration was missing DOM types for browser components

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Type Interfaces**:
   - Added `estimated_hours` and `isCritical` properties to `DependencyNode` interface
   - Added `fromX`, `fromY`, `toX`, `toY`, and `isCritical` properties to `DependencyEdge` interface

2. **Fixed Import/Export Issues**:
   - Resolved App.svelte imports for store functions (`isTaskDetailOpen`, `openTaskDetail`, `closeTaskDetail`)
   - Added missing `Task` type import in parseBacklog.ts
   - Fixed `import.meta.env` access in config.ts with proper Vite type reference

3. **Improved Type Safety**:
   - Enhanced FilterPanel.svelte event handler typing with proper HTML element types
   - Fixed conditional rendering logic in App.svelte for TaskDetail modal
   - Added explicit type assertions in parseBacklog.ts for task object spread

4. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Added `vite-env.d.ts` to tsconfig.json includes
   - Enhanced eslint.config.js with DOM types for browser globals
   - Added `/// <reference types="vite/client" />` to config.ts

**Key Tools Used**:
- `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` - Real-time TypeScript error detection
- `npx tsc --noEmit` - TypeScript compilation validation
- `pnpm run lint:viewer` - ESLint validation
- `pnpm run viewer:build` - Build process validation

**Results**:
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ ESLint configuration properly testing viewer app
- ✅ Build process successful
- ✅ Real-time IDE type checking working correctly
- ✅ Comprehensive type safety maintained

**Follow-up User Request**: "Log, commit, and plan the next phase of work"
