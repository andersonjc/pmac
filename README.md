# Project Management as Code (PMaC)

A file-based methodology for AI-assisted software development that keeps all project management data version-controlled alongside your codebase.

🛠️ **CLI Tools Available**: Install the [PMaC CLI](https://github.com/andersonjc/pmac-cli) for easy setup and powerful task management: `npm install -g pmac-cli`

## Why PMaC?

Traditional project management tools (Jira, Linear, Asana) store data in proprietary systems that don't integrate well with AI coding assistants. PMaC solves this by using **version-controlled files** that provide complete project context to both humans and AI.

### Key Benefits

- **🤖 AI-Native**: Structured YAML/Markdown that AI assistants can read and update
- **📝 Complete Audit Trail**: Every decision, requirement change, and prompt is tracked
- **⚡ Zero Context Loss**: Resume complex projects seamlessly with full historical context
- **🔄 Git Integration**: Project management data evolves with your code
- **🏗️ Quality Assurance**: Built-in protocols ensure production-ready code

📚 **[Read the Complete Methodology](project-management-as-code.md)** - Full documentation of the PMaC approach and workflows.

## Real-World Usage

PMaC is designed for projects where:

- Solo engineers or full teams work with AI coding assistants
- Requirements evolve frequently
- Audit trails are important
- Quality and testing standards are high
- Context preservation is critical

**Perfect for**: Startups, enterprise features, open source projects, consulting work

**Works with**: Any AI assistant (Claude, GPT, etc.), any tech stack, any team size

## Quick Start

1. **Get the templates**: Copy PMaC files from the [templates/](templates/) directory
2. **Customize**: Edit files to match your project requirements
3. **Optional CLI**: Install [PMaC CLI](https://github.com/andersonjc/pmac-cli) for easy setup and enhanced task management: `npm install -g pmac-cli`

## Core PMaC Files

PMaC uses four interconnected files that work together:

| File                          | Purpose                                        | Format   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **`project-backlog.yml`**     | Task management, dependencies, status tracking | YAML     |
| **`prompts-log.md`**          | Complete conversation history and decisions    | Markdown |
| **`CLAUDE.md`**               | AI assistant instructions and project guidance | Markdown |
| **`project-requirements.md`** | Technical architecture and requirements        | Markdown |

## PMaC CLI Tools

For enhanced productivity, install the **[PMaC CLI](https://github.com/andersonjc/pmac-cli)** - a powerful command-line tool and an interactive backlog viewer:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g pmac-cli

# Example commands
pmac list                    # List all tasks
pmac update TASK-001 done   # Update task status
pmac viewer                 # Launch interactive viewer
pmac critical-path          # Show critical path analysis
```

📚 **Full CLI Documentation**: See the [PMaC CLI repository](https://github.com/andersonjc/pmac-cli) for complete command reference and features.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Pick a Task

```bash
pmac list ready high  # Find high-priority ready tasks (CLI)
```

### 2. Start Work

```bash
pmac update TASK-001 in_progress "Starting implementation"  # CLI
git checkout -b feature/TASK-001-description
```

### 3. Follow Protocol

- ✅ Read task requirements and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Follow technical requirements exactly
- ✅ Update task notes with implementation decisions
- ✅ Log all AI prompts in `prompts-log.md`

### 4. Complete & Validate

```bash
# Validate all acceptance criteria met
pmac update TASK-001 completed "All criteria validated"  # CLI

# Commit PMaC files with code changes
git add .
git commit -m "TASK-001: Implement feature XYZ

✅ All acceptance criteria met
📝 Updated PMaC files
🤖 Generated with Claude Code"
```

## Example Task Structure

```yaml
# project-backlog.yml
phases:
  development:
    tasks:
      - id: AUTH-001
        title: "Implement JWT Authentication"
        status: "ready"
        priority: "high"
        estimated_hours: 8
        requirements:
          - "Create JWT token generation endpoint"
          - "Implement token validation middleware"
          - "Add refresh token mechanism"
        acceptance_criteria:
          - "✅ Users can login and receive valid JWT tokens"
          - "✅ Protected routes validate tokens correctly"
          - "✅ Refresh tokens work without re-authentication"
          - "✅ All tests pass with >95% coverage"
        dependencies: ["SETUP-001"]
        notes: []
```

## Quality Assurance

PMaC includes a **Senior Engineer Task Execution Protocol**:

1. **📋 Clarify Scope**: Map requirements to specific implementation
2. **🎯 Locate Insertion Points**: Identify exact files and lines to modify
3. **⚡ Minimal Changes**: Only code required for acceptance criteria
4. **✅ Validate Everything**: Run tests, check criteria, verify no regressions
5. **📝 Document & Update**: Update PMaC files with all changes

## Best Practices

### For Teams

- Always commit PMaC files with code changes
- Use task IDs in branch names and commit messages
- Include acceptance criteria validation in PRs
- Review PMaC files during code reviews

### For AI Collaboration

- Log every prompt and decision in `prompts-log.md`
- Update task status as work progresses
- Reference task IDs when asking for help
- Maintain complete audit trail

### For Quality

- Write specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Aim for 100% test coverage on new code
- Follow the Senior Engineer Protocol religiously
- Validate all criteria before marking tasks complete

## Acknowledgments

This methodology was inspired by Max Mitchell's concept of "prompts as source code" from his analysis of [Cloudflare's Claude-generated commits](https://www.maxemitchell.com/writings/i-read-all-of-cloudflares-claude-generated-commits/).

The independent emergence of similar concepts, such as the [PMAC project](https://github.com/schneidergithub/pmac) by schneidergithub, demonstrates the industry's shared need for standardized AI-assisted development practices.
