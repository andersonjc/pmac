**PMaC Methodology**: This file implements the decision tracking component of Project Management as Code as documented in `../../project-management-as-code.md`

**Related Files**:

- `../../project-management-as-code.md` - Complete PMaC methodology documentation
- `project-requirements.md` - Technical requirements and architecture specifications
- `project-backlog.yml` - Task management and progress tracking
- `../../CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant instructions ensuring PMaC compliance

**Purpose**: Maintain complete audit trail of all development decisions, technical discussions, and requirement evolution throughout the PMaC Backlog Viewer project lifecycle.

## Prompt Log Entries

### 2025-01-14 11:47:15 p.m. EST - Project Initialization

**Task Reference**: VIEWER-001  
**Prompt Type**: [REQUIREMENT]  
**Context**: Initial project setup for PMaC Backlog Viewer development

**Content**:

```
Read the project documents and PMaC Backlog Viewer requirements doc. Add PMaC-based tasks to develop the viewer app. Home the documentation inside the ./tools/viewer folder.
```

**Outcome**: Reading project documents and requirements to create comprehensive PMaC-based task structure for developing the dark mode Svelte + Tailwind viewer app. Created directory structure and PMaC files within ./tools/viewer/ to keep viewer development assets separate from main project.

**Files Modified**:

- `tools/viewer/prompts-log.md` (created with initial entry)
- `tools/viewer/` (directory created)

### 2025-01-14 11:56:32 p.m. EST - Begin Development

**Task Reference**: VIEWER-001  
**Prompt Type**: [IMPLEMENTATION]  
**Context**: Starting development following PMaC methodology

**Content**:

```
Begin development, adhering strictly to pmac
```

**Outcome**: Beginning VIEWER-001 task implementation - setting up complete project structure with Svelte + TypeScript + Tailwind configuration

**Files Modified**:

- `tools/viewer/prompts-log.md` (updated with new entry)

---

### 2025-01-14 11:59:45 p.m. EST - Configuration Integration Decision

**Task Reference**: VIEWER-001  
**Prompt Type**: [DECISION]  
**Context**: User feedback on configuration approach

**Content**:

```
Other files like tsconfig.json should be integrated with top level. Reassess, fix, and continue. Follow PMaC.
```

**Outcome**: Decided to integrate all configuration files at top level for simplicity. Moving tsconfig, tailwind, postcss configs to root level to avoid nested project complexity.

**Files Modified**:

- `tools/viewer/prompts-log.md` (updated with decision entry)

## Development Decision Categories

### Architecture Decisions

**Dark Mode Svelte + Tailwind Stack**: Based on requirements document, chose Svelte with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for optimal developer experience with dark mode design system.

### Product Requirements Evolution

_Changes to product requirements and user stories_

### Implementation Approach

**PMaC CLI Integration**: Viewer will integrate with existing PMaC CLI tool as `pnpm pmac viewer` command, reading project-backlog.yml files from any path.

### Integration Decisions

**YAML Parser Integration**: Will use existing YAML parsing from main PMaC CLI tool for consistency.

### Performance & Scalability

**Static Build Option**: Viewer will support both dev server and static build for distribution.

### Security & Privacy

**Local File Access**: Viewer operates on local YAML files only, no network access or data transmission.

### Testing Strategy

**Component Testing**: Focus on testing YAML parsing, task filtering, and UI component rendering.

---

## Quick Reference

### Current Sprint

- **Phase**: foundation
- **Active Tasks**: Setting up PMaC files structure
- **Next Priorities**: Create comprehensive task breakdown for viewer development

### Key Architecture Decisions Made

- **Framework**: Svelte with TypeScript for reactive UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode design system
- **Distribution**: Integrated as PMaC CLI tool
- **File Structure**: Isolated in ./tools/viewer/ for clean separation

### Outstanding Questions

- Integration strategy with existing PMaC CLI tool
- Build and distribution approach for viewer
- Testing strategy for Svelte components

### Technical Debt & Future Considerations

- Consider hot module replacement for development
- Plan for potential light mode support in future
- Consider mobile responsiveness for tablet usage
