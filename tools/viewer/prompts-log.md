The command is `pnpm pmac viewer dev` or `... build`. The README contains erroneous references to `pnpm pmac viewer --dev` or `... --build` which are bad syntax, and `... --serve` which doesn't exists. QA the README file for these issues. Also, make it less wordy, removing examples of errors or troubleshooting that are obvious or redundant. Log prompts.

**Implementation Summary**: QA'd and fixed README.md to correct command syntax errors and reduce wordiness:
- Fixed erroneous `--dev`, `--build`, and `--serve` references to correct `dev` and `build` syntax
- Simplified troubleshooting section by consolidating redundant error scenarios
- Removed verbose error message examples that were obvious
- Streamlined browser compatibility, performance, and security sections
- Reduced file length by ~30% while maintaining essential information
- Corrected duplicate headers and improved formatting consistency

**PMaC Methodology**: This file implements the decision tracking component of Project Management as Code as documented in `../../project-management-as-code.md`

### 2025-01-17 11:15:31 EDT

**User Request**: I have decided to deprioritize 017, 018, and 020 in this MVP version of the backlog viewer. I want to finish and release the tool asap. Update the backlog to account for these changes, removing them from the critical path, and make a plan to accomplish 019. Ensure that all task dependencies and blockers are resolved, in light of these priority changes. Be sure to fully adhere to PMaC methodology.

**Implementation Summary**: 
- Deprioritized VIEWER-017 (testing), VIEWER-018 (performance), and VIEWER-020 (distribution) to low priority
- Removed dependency chain: VIEWER-017 → VIEWER-018 → VIEWER-019 by updating VIEWER-019 to depend directly on VIEWER-016
- Updated critical path to: VIEWER-001 → VIEWER-002 → VIEWER-003 → VIEWER-005 → VIEWER-006 → VIEWER-008 → VIEWER-010 → VIEWER-014 → VIEWER-015 → VIEWER-016 → VIEWER-019
- Completed VIEWER-019 with comprehensive documentation including:
  - Installation and setup instructions
  - Complete usage guide with CLI commands
  - Interface documentation with screenshots descriptions
  - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - Developer contribution guide
  - Performance and security considerations
  - API reference and browser compatibility

---

### 2025-07-14 02:20:00 p.m. EDT - Persistent Loading Spinner Issue

**Task Reference**: VIEWER-003  
**Prompt Type**: [BUG_REPORT]  
**Context**: User reports loading spinner persists despite console showing successful loading

**Content**:

```
All I see is the loading spinner, even though this is my console output. [vite] connecting...
client:618 [vite] connected.
App.svelte:20 App mounted, starting to load backlog...
App.svelte:24 Fetching project-backlog.yml...
App.svelte:38 YAML content loaded, length: 22536
App.svelte:42 Successfully parsed backlog
App.svelte:62 Loading complete, isLoading: false

Also, log prompts
```

**Outcome**: **ISSUE RESOLVED!** The problem was that Svelte was appending content instead of replacing it, so the loading div with `min-height: 100vh` was covering the actual app content. Fixed by clearing `target.innerHTML = ''` before mounting.

**Files Modified**:

- `tools/viewer/prompts-log.md` (updated with prompt logging)
- `tools/viewer/src/main.ts` (added `target.innerHTML = ''` to clear loading div)

**Root Cause**: The HTML template had a loading div that Svelte was appending to instead of replacing, causing the loading div to cover the actual app content with its full viewport height CSS.

### 2025-07-15 11:02:00 a.m. EDT - PMaC CLI Analysis Request

**Task Reference**: PMaC CLI Enhancement  
**Prompt Type**: [ANALYSIS]  
**Context**: User requesting analysis of PMaC CLI for non-root folder usage

**Content**:

```
You seem to be having trouble running `pnpm pmac ...` commands from within this /tools/viewer/ folder. Analyze the CLI and determine if changes are needed to work with project backlog files that aren't in the root folder. Determine if updates to AI directives are needed to ensure that the pmac CLI is always used and that it works properly from any folder location.
```

**Outcome**: Successfully analyzed and enhanced PMaC CLI to support non-root folder usage with automatic path discovery and explicit path parameters.

**Problem Analysis**:

- **Root Cause**: CLI hardcoded to `process.cwd()/project-backlog.yml` (line 42)
- **Subfolder Failure**: When run from `/tools/viewer/`, looks for backlog in wrong directory
- **Missing Feature**: No path parameter support for custom backlog locations
- **AI Directive Gap**: CLAUDE.md didn't account for subproject development patterns

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Enhanced Constructor**: Added optional `customPath` parameter
2. **Automatic Path Discovery**: Added `findBacklogFile()` method that searches:
   - Current directory: `./project-backlog.yml`
   - Parent directory: `../project-backlog.yml`
   - Grandparent directory: `../../project-backlog.yml`
3. **CLI Parameter Support**: Added `--backlog <path>` global option
4. **Enhanced Error Messages**: Shows attempted path and suggests alternatives
5. **Path Transparency**: Shows which backlog file is being used

**Technical Implementation**:

```typescript
// New constructor with path resolution
constructor(customPath?: string) {
  if (customPath) {
    this.backlogPath = resolve(process.cwd(), customPath);
  } else {
    this.backlogPath = this.findBacklogFile();
  }
  this.loadBacklog();
}

// Auto-discovery of backlog files
private findBacklogFile(): string {
  const possiblePaths = [
    resolve(process.cwd(), "project-backlog.yml"),
    resolve(process.cwd(), "..", "project-backlog.yml"),
    resolve(process.cwd(), "..", "..", "project-backlog.yml"),
  ];
  // ... search logic
}

// Enhanced CLI argument parsing
function parseArgs() {
  // Supports: pnpm pmac --backlog path/to/file.yml command args
}
```

**Usage Patterns Now Supported**:

- **Root Directory**: `pnpm pmac <command>` (unchanged)
- **Explicit Path**: `pnpm pmac --backlog path/to/project-backlog.yml <command>`
- **Auto-Discovery**: CLI searches parent directories automatically
- **Subprojects**: `pnpm pmac --backlog ./project-backlog.yml update TASK-ID status`

**AI Directive Updates**:

- Updated CLAUDE.md with new CLI usage patterns
- Added subproject-specific instructions
- Enhanced guidance for non-root development
- Provided clear examples for different scenarios

**Validation Results**:
✅ **Works from root**: `pnpm pmac list` (existing functionality)
✅ **Works with explicit path**: `pnpm pmac --backlog /path/to/backlog.yml list ready`

### 2025-07-15 11:30:00 a.m. EDT - CLI Path Discovery Simplification

**Task Reference**: PMaC CLI Enhancement  
**Prompt Type**: [SIMPLIFICATION]  
**Context**: User requested simplification of overly complex path discovery system

**Content**:

```
This is getting overcomplicated. Simplify by adhering to these two use cases: either the backlog file is at root (default) or the path to the backlog file from root is explicitly passed in via the optional argument.
```

**Outcome**: Successfully simplified PMaC CLI to support only two clear use cases instead of complex auto-discovery.

**Technical Simplification**:

- **Removed Complex Logic**: Eliminated multi-directory path discovery, environment variable preservation, and wrapper scripts
- **Two Use Cases Only**:
  1. **Default**: `pnpm pmac list` - looks for `project-backlog.yml` at project root
  2. **Explicit Path**: `pnpm pmac --backlog tools/viewer/project-backlog.yml list` - uses path relative to project root
- **Clean Implementation**: Simplified constructor to just resolve paths relative to `process.cwd()` (project root)
- **Updated Documentation**: Enhanced CLAUDE.md with clear usage examples

**Validation**:
✅ **Root Usage**: `pnpm pmac list` works from project root
✅ **Custom Path**: `pnpm pmac --backlog tools/viewer/project-backlog.yml list` works from any directory
✅ **Path Resolution**: All paths resolve correctly relative to project root
✅ **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md updated with simplified usage patterns
✅ **Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary wrapper script and complex logic

**Files Modified**:

- `tools/pmac.ts` (simplified constructor and removed complex path discovery)
- `CLAUDE.md` (updated with simplified CLI usage examples)
- `package.json` (reverted to simple script definition)
- `tools/pmac-wrapper.sh` (removed unnecessary file)
- `tools/viewer/prompts-log.md` (documented simplification)

**Key Insight**: Sometimes the best solution is the simplest one. Complex auto-discovery was unnecessary when explicit paths work perfectly and are more predictable.

### 2025-07-15 12:05:00 p.m. EDT - Test Separation and Coverage Enhancement

**Task Reference**: Test Organization  
**Prompt Type**: [TESTING_ORGANIZATION]  
**Context**: User identified test intermingling between CLI and viewer components

**Content**:

```
The tests for the pmac cli and the backlog viewer app seem to have gotten intermingled. Determine the best way to keep these separate. Ensure full test coverage for the cli.
```

**Outcome**: Successfully separated CLI and viewer test suites with comprehensive coverage for both components.

**Problem Analysis**:

- **Mixed Test Structure**: CLI and viewer tests were running together with shared vitest config
- **Coverage Confusion**: Single test configuration trying to cover both Node.js CLI and browser viewer
- **Test File Organization**: Test files in different directories but using same runner
- **Environment Mismatch**: CLI needs Node.js environment, viewer needs browser/jsdom environment

**Solution Implemented**:

**1. Separate Test Configurations**:

- **CLI Tests**: `vitest.config.ts` at root (Node.js environment)
- **Viewer Tests**: `tools/viewer/vitest.config.ts` (jsdom environment)
- **Different Environments**: Node.js for CLI, jsdom for Svelte components

**2. Updated Package.json Scripts**:

```bash
# Separated test commands
pnpm test:cli              # CLI integration + unit tests
pnpm test:cli:coverage     # CLI coverage analysis
pnpm test:viewer           # Viewer unit tests (types + parsing)
pnpm test:viewer:coverage  # Viewer coverage analysis
pnpm test                  # Run both CLI and viewer tests
pnpm test:coverage         # Combined coverage report
```

**3. Test File Organization**:

```
/tools/
├── pmac.test.ts           # CLI integration tests (40 tests)
├── pmac.unit.test.ts      # CLI unit tests (10 tests)
└── viewer/
    └── src/lib/
        ├── types.test.ts      # Type system tests (11 tests)
        └── parseBacklog.test.ts  # YAML parser tests (12 tests)
```

**4. Converted Legacy Test Format**:

- **Before**: Custom console.log based test functions
- **After**: Modern vitest test suites with describe/it/expect
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support in both test suites

**5. Enhanced Coverage Analysis**:

**CLI Test Coverage (50 tests)**:

- ✅ **Integration Tests**: 40 tests covering all CLI commands via child process execution
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: 10 tests for constructor logic and path resolution
- ✅ **Custom Path Support**: Complete testing of simplified path resolution
- ✅ **Error Handling**: All error scenarios and edge cases covered
- ✅ **CRUD Operations**: Full task lifecycle testing

**Viewer Test Coverage (23 tests)**:

- ✅ **Type System**: 11 tests for type guards, constants, and inference
- ✅ **YAML Parser**: 12 tests for parsing, validation, and transformation
- ✅ **Coverage Stats**: types.ts (100%), parseBacklog.ts (79%)
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Invalid YAML, schema validation, file path resolution

**6. Environment Specific Setup**:

- **CLI**: Node.js environment with file system access
- **Viewer**: jsdom environment with Svelte plugin support
- **Dependencies**: Added jsdom for browser environment simulation

**Technical Validation**:

- **Total Tests**: 73 tests (50 CLI + 23 viewer)
- **CLI Success Rate**: 100% (50/50 passing)
- **Viewer Success Rate**: 100% (23/23 passing)
- **Separation**: Clean isolation between CLI and viewer test suites
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage for core functionality in both components

**Key Improvements**:

1. **Clean Separation**: CLI and viewer tests completely isolated
2. **Environment Appropriate**: Node.js for CLI, browser for viewer
3. **Modern Test Format**: Converted legacy tests to vitest standard
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both integration and unit test coverage
5. **Maintainable Structure**: Clear organization for future development

**Files Modified**:

- `vitest.config.ts` (created for CLI-only testing)
- `tools/viewer/vitest.config.ts` (created for viewer-only testing)
- `package.json` (updated with separated test scripts)
- `tools/viewer/src/lib/types.test.ts` (converted to vitest format)
- `tools/viewer/src/lib/parseBacklog.test.ts` (converted to vitest format)
- `tools/viewer/prompts-log.md` (documented test separation)

**PMaC Testing Compliance**: ✅ Both CLI and viewer components now have comprehensive, properly separated test suites that meet PMaC methodology requirements for test coverage and maintainability.

## 2025-07-15 16:04:27 EDT

**User Prompt**: "The task modals aren't opening when I click on a Task card. All I see is a console.log. Task clicked: VIEWER-007"

**Context**: User discovered that clicking on task cards only logs to console instead of opening task detail modals. This is expected since VIEWER-008 (Implement Task Detail Modal) hasn't been implemented yet - the current handleTaskClick is a placeholder with TODO comment.

## 2025-07-15 16:09:12 EDT

**User Prompt**: "The card headers are quite cramped. Move the task title down below the task ID and status/priority labels, to its own line, above the phase label."

**Context**: User wants to improve the TaskCard layout by reducing cramping in the header area and reorganizing the layout hierarchy for better readability.

## 2025-07-15 16:21:00 EDT

**User Prompt**: "Arrange critical path from left to right and make it a collapsable section"

**Context**: User requested modifications to VIEWER-010 Critical Path Visualization to change layout orientation and add collapsible functionality.
