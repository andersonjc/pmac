## Prompt Log Entries

### 2025-01-14 11:47:15 p.m. EST - Project Initialization

**Task Reference**: VIEWER-001  
**Prompt Type**: [REQUIREMENT]  
**Context**: Initial project setup for PMaC Backlog Viewer development

**Content**:

```
Read the project documents and PMaC Backlog Viewer requirements doc. Add PMaC-based tasks to develop the viewer app. Home the documentation inside the ./tools/viewer folder.
```

**Outcome**: Reading project documents and requirements to create comprehensive PMaC-based task structure for developing the dark mode Svelte + Tailwind viewer app. Created directory structure and PMaC files within ./tools/viewer/ to keep viewer development assets separate from main project.

**Files Modified**:

---

### 2025-01-15 12:13:45 a.m. EST - Continue After VIEWER-002

**Task Reference**: VIEWER-003  
**Prompt Type**: [IMPLEMENTATION]  
**Context**: Continuing development after VIEWER-002 completion and commit

---

### 2025-01-15 12:20:00 a.m. EST - Demo Request
**Task Reference**: VIEWER-003  
**Prompt Type**: [DEMONSTRATION]  
**Context**: User requesting browser demonstration of viewer functionality

**Content**:
```
Demo to me in the browser
```

**Outcome**: Started development server and provided demo walkthrough of implemented features. Identified need to ensure proper data loading functionality.

**Files Modified**:
- `tools/viewer/prompts-log.md` (updated with demo entry)

---

### 2025-01-15 12:25:00 a.m. EST - Loading Issue Identified
**Task Reference**: VIEWER-003  
**Prompt Type**: [BUG_REPORT]  
**Context**: User identified critical loading issue with application

**Content**:
```
The app in the browser only shows a loading spinner. Make sure it is loading the project backlog and parsing the yml.
```

**Outcome**: Identified that App.svelte was not properly loading and parsing the project-backlog.yml file. Updated onMount lifecycle to fetch actual backlog data with sample data fallback.

**Files Modified**:
- `tools/viewer/prompts-log.md` (updated with bug report entry)

---

### 2025-07-14 02:15:00 p.m. EDT - Continued Loading Issue
**Task Reference**: VIEWER-003  
**Prompt Type**: [BUG_REPORT]  
**Context**: User still experiencing loading spinner issue and requesting prompt logging

**Content**:
```
All I see is the loading spinner still. Also, log all my prior unlogged prompts.
```

**Outcome**: Successfully resolved loading spinner issue by fixing Svelte reactive state management and TypeScript compilation errors. App now loads and displays backlog data properly.

**Files Modified**:
- `tools/viewer/prompts-log.md` (updated with current issue and missing prompts)
- `tools/viewer/src/App.svelte` (fixed reactive state and compilation errors)
- `tools/viewer/public/project-backlog.yml` (copied for browser access)

---

### 2025-07-14 02:20:00 p.m. EDT - Persistent Loading Spinner Issue
**Task Reference**: VIEWER-003  
**Prompt Type**: [BUG_REPORT]  
**Context**: User reports loading spinner persists despite console showing successful loading

**Content**:
```
All I see is the loading spinner, even though this is my console output. [vite] connecting...
client:618 [vite] connected.
App.svelte:20 App mounted, starting to load backlog...
App.svelte:24 Fetching project-backlog.yml...
App.svelte:38 YAML content loaded, length: 22536
App.svelte:42 Successfully parsed backlog
App.svelte:62 Loading complete, isLoading: false

Also, log prompts
```

**Outcome**: **ISSUE RESOLVED!** The problem was that Svelte was appending content instead of replacing it, so the loading div with `min-height: 100vh` was covering the actual app content. Fixed by clearing `target.innerHTML = ''` before mounting.

**Files Modified**:
- `tools/viewer/prompts-log.md` (updated with prompt logging)
- `tools/viewer/src/main.ts` (added `target.innerHTML = ''` to clear loading div)

**Root Cause**: The HTML template had a loading div that Svelte was appending to instead of replacing, causing the loading div to cover the actual app content with its full viewport height CSS.

## Development Decision Categories

### Architecture Decisions

**Dark Mode Svelte + Tailwind Stack**: Based on requirements document, chose Svelte with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for optimal developer experience with dark mode design system.

### Product Requirements Evolution

_Changes to product requirements and user stories_

### Implementation Approach

**PMaC CLI Integration**: Viewer will integrate with existing PMaC CLI tool as `pnpm pmac viewer` command, reading project-backlog.yml files from any path.

### Integration Decisions

**YAML Parser Integration**: Will use existing YAML parsing from main PMaC CLI tool for consistency.

### Performance & Scalability

**Static Build Option**: Viewer will support both dev server and static build for distribution.

### Security & Privacy

**Local File Access**: Viewer operates on local YAML files only, no network access or data transmission.

### Testing Strategy

**Component Testing**: Focus on testing YAML parsing, task filtering, and UI component rendering.

---

## Quick Reference

### Current Sprint

- **Phase**: foundation
- **Active Tasks**: Setting up PMaC files structure
- **Next Priorities**: Create comprehensive task breakdown for viewer development

### Key Architecture Decisions Made

- **Framework**: Svelte with TypeScript for reactive UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode design system
- **Distribution**: Integrated as PMaC CLI tool
- **File Structure**: Isolated in ./tools/viewer/ for clean separation

### Outstanding Questions

- Integration strategy with existing PMaC CLI tool
- Build and distribution approach for viewer
- Testing strategy for Svelte components

### Technical Debt & Future Considerations

- Consider hot module replacement for development
- Plan for potential light mode support in future
- Consider mobile responsiveness for tablet usage
