## PMaC Integration Notes

This document integrates with the Project Management as Code methodology:

- **Task References**: All requirements should be traceable to tasks in `project-backlog.yml`
- **Decision Tracking**: Major architectural decisions logged in `prompts-log.md`
- **Implementation Guidance**: Specific technical guidance provided in `CLAUDE.md`
- **Version Control**: This document evolves with the project and is versioned alongside code

**PMaC Compliance Requirements**:
- All feature development must reference specific sections of this document
- Changes to requirements must be documented in `prompts-log.md`
- Task acceptance criteria must validate against requirements specified here
- AI assistants must validate implementations against this architecture
